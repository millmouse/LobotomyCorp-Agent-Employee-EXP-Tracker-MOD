Tired of guessing if your employees are ready to level up? Take out the guesswork of employee management and get more strategic with your Lobotomy Corporation. Make more informed decisions managing your employees. Perfect for players who love detailed stats.

Track EXP Progress & Optimize Your Training.
Prints how much progress an employee has made toward their RWBP level directly to the notice/chat window. It will tell you if you have levelled up or how close you are to leveling. Avoid overworking maxed-out employees and focus on those who need the experience points the most, so you don’t waste time on employees who have already hit their level cap. It makes the data transparent for you in the notice board.

Especially useful for tracking team’s leveling progress during the early stages, early save or early gameplay. You can use this mod even if you have not finished the game. It will not give you an advantage other than information.
Works well alongside the Detailed Info mod to give you a complete picture of your employee stats. It is not a replacement.

## Important Notes

**EX Stats Not Tracked:**
Currently, the mod does not currently track employees' EX stat (maximum level cap) progress and is limited to levels 1–5.

**Promotion Prediction:**
This mod does not predict promotion titles or rank-ups for your agent’s overall level. Only RWBP stat levels.

**E.G.O. Gifts Excluded:**
E.G.O. gift effects are not considered in the calculations, this is so you can focus purely on level progression without modifiers.

**No GUI Integration:**
This mod does not modify the GUI; it only prints results to the chat and logs. provides data via chat and .txt logs only.
